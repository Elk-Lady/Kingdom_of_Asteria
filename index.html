    <h1>The Kindom of Asteria</h1>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Welcome to the Kingdom of Asteria! Here you can get a brief overview of the kingdom and it’s history.</p>
        <P>They originated from a world called Aevongard. It was a large pangea continent being torn apart by a magical contamination/corruption when they left. Causing great earthquakes and consuming villages, towns, and cities at an alarming rate.</P> 
        <p>This contamination is rumored to begin at the underdark, it was only through survivors that people knew of the incident. It wasn’t believed at first, until the first earthquake began. Devastating and sprouting a strange gooey liquid from the ground. Anything it touched seemed to morph into something twisted and unique.</p>
        <p>The contamination is destructive and poisonous in its nature. Those that refused to run were consumed by it. Any attempts to investigate caused the contamination to spread further through the “hosting” body. Peoples bodies twisted and busted into a strange abomination, striking fear into the people of the lands.</p>
        <p>The Kingdom of Asteria is one of many who were forced to flee due to the quick spread of the contamination. They lost many villages and towns, and many refugees were looked upon with fear that they carried the strange infection.</P>
